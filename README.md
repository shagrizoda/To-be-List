# To-be-List
Used:

-**RealmSwift** to save data

-**SwipeCellKit** to delete items by swiping

-**ChameleonFramework** to generate random background colors of cells, gradients, contrasting tint colors

Looks like a To do list app, but it focuses on how you want to feel, rather than what you need to do
Each time a new category cell added, **random backround color** for it is generated (ChameleonFramework)

Background color of item cell is the **gradient** color of its category cell (ChameleonFramework)
